**To display the Magnetic field vs current graph**

1. Select the procedure ‘magnetic field vs current’ from the menu
2. Click on “Insert Hall sensor’ 
3. Add magnetic field values displayed on the gauss meter to the table by clicking the various choice of current starting from 200mA to 500mA with a 50 mA interval
4. Click on the ‘Observations’ and then click on the “I/B GRAPH” button to plot the graph of Magnetic field vs Current from the displayed observation table
5. Close the graph and click on ‘Reset’ button.
